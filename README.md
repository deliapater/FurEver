# FINAL PROJECT.- Fur Ever<br>
**Team Project: 3 contributors**

## Intro:
We have been approached to build an app for dog owners who wish to breed or meet their pets for social activities.  The app should allow users create a profile for their dog(s) and be able to to contact any member of the site.  The app should allow members to leave comments and ratings on other dogs.

## MVP
The app should have a Dog and a User component.

The application must have a Navigation Bar.

Users must be able to create a profile for each dog they own.

Users should have a name, email address and dogs.

Dogs should have a name, location, gender, age, breed and a user.

User must be able to filter for other dogs and filter results based on preference:
	Breed
	Location
	Gender
	Age

Users must be able to contact each other privately via a direct message.

Users must be able to add a public comment in others users(pets) walls.

## Extensions
Add a location map.
Add a method that allows the user to upload photos to the server.
Add an Adoptable Pets section.
The newest members(pets) could be display in the home page carousel.
Extended for pets of any type.
