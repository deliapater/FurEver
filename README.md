# FINAL PROJECT.- Fur Ever<br>
**Team Project: 3 contributors**

## Intro
We have been approached to build an app for dog owners who wish to breed or meet their pets for social activities.  The app should allow users create a profile for their dog(s) and be able to to contact any member of the site.  The app should allow members to leave comments and ratings on other dogs.

## MVP
The app should have a Dog and a User component.

The application must have a Navigation Bar.

Users must be able to create a profile for each dog they own.

Users should have a name, email address and dogs.

Dogs should have a name, location, gender, age, breed and a user.

User must be able to filter for other dogs and filter results based on preference:
	Breed
	Location
	Gender
	Age

Users must be able to add a public comment in others users(pets) walls.

## Extensions
Add a location map.<br>
Users could be able to contact each other privately via a direct message.<br>
Add a method that allows the user to upload photos to the server.<br>
Extended for pets of any type.<br>
